Command Validator for DMC-4103 Controller

Validates motor setup commands against the DMC-4103 command reference.
Includes all commands from the DMC-4103 command reference and examples.

_   Operand Overview
Not Burnable Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program
Operand Usage
Operands allow motion or status parameters of the controller to be incorporated into programmable variables and expressions. Most DMC commands have an equivalent operand - which are designated by adding an underscore (_) prior to the DMC command. An operand typically contains the value of the command associated with it, for instance _TPA contains the current position of axis A. Below is an example of proper and improper usage for an operand.

Example Usage
'Galil DMC Code Example
'Correct usage
MG _TPA;' Message the A Axis' current position.
err = _TC;' Save the current error code to a variable, err.

'Incorrect usage
_TPA;' Sending this to the controller will result in an error, as operands are not valid commands on their own. 
Special Operands
The majority of DMC operands return information directly related to their command. However, there are a few operands which provide access to internal variables that are not accessible by standard DMC commands. Below is a list of special operands which contain information not stored in a typical DMC command.

For more details on the content of these operands, see their associated command page.

Special Operand	Description
_BN	Contains the controller's serial number.
_BV	Contains the number of axes on the controller.
_DA	Contains the number of array space left in the controller's memory.
_DL	Contains the number of label space left in the controller's memory.
_DM	Contains the number of array space left in the controller's memory.
_ED0	Contains the line number where an error last occured.
_ED1	Contains the thread where an error last occured.
_ED4	Contains the thread ID of the thread evaluating the operand.
_HXn	Contains the running status of thread 'n'.
_NO	Contains a bitmask of the running threads.
_RS	Contains a bitmask of checksum errors.
_UL	Contains the number of variables left in the controller's memory.
_XQn	Contains the current line number of thread 'n'.
TIME	Contains the current value of the controller's free running clock.

_GP   Gearing Phase Differential Operand
Not Burnable Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program Variable axis supported
_GPm
Usage	variable= _GP	Holds a value
Operands	_GPm
Operand has special meaning, see Remarks
Description
The _GP operand contains the value of the specified slave's "phase differential" accumulated on the most recent change in the gear ratio between the master and the slave axes. The value does not update if the distance over which the slave will engage is set to 0 with the GD command.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
m	A	H	N/A	Axis	Axis of interest	
Remarks
An operand is not valid individually. Instead, _GP would be used in an expression. See example below.
Phase Differential is a term that is used to describe the lead or lag between a master axis and the specified slave axis due to gradual gear shift.
See application note 2440 for more information on _GP and GD.
Examples
'Galil DMC Code Example
GA DA;'   Sets the A axis aux encoder as the gearing master for the A axis.  
GD1000;'  Set the distance that the master will travel to 1000 
'         counts before the gearing is fully engaged for the A 
'         axis slave.
AI-1;'    Wait for input 1 to go low.  In this example, this 
'         input is representing a sensor that senses an object 
'         on a conveyor.  This will trigger the controller to 
'         begin gearing and synchronize the master and slave 
'         axes together.
GR1;'     Engage gearing between the master and slave
p1=_TDA;' Sets the current A axis position to variable P1.  This 
'         variable is used in the next command
#wait
'         Wait for the aux encoder to move forward 1000 
'         encoder counts so the gearing engagement period is 
'         complete.  Then the phase difference can be adjusted 
'         for.  Note this example assumes forward motion.
JP#wait,  (_TDA < (p1+1000))
IP _GPA;' Increment the difference to bring the master/slave in 
'         position sync from the point that the GR1 command was 
'         issued.
EN;'      End Program

#   Label Designator
Not Burnable Not Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program
#str
Description
The # denotes the name of a program label, for example, #move. Labels are often used to implement subroutines or loops. Labels are either user-defined or are reserved names, called "automatic subroutines", that automatically execute when a particular event occurs.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description
str	1 char	7 chars	N/A	String	Name of label
Remarks
Labels can include the characters A-Z, a-z, 1-9. Numbers can not be the first character. All other characters are invalid.
A label can only be defined at the beginning of a new line.
The number of labels available can be queried with MG _DL.
LL returns the current label table in the controller.
Galil recommends that at least the first character be lowercase for user labels to differentiate from automatic subroutines.
Automatic subroutines are listed in the command reference starting with a # character.
There is a maximum of 510 labels available.

#AMPERR   Amplifier error automatic subroutine
Not Burnable Not Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program
#AMPERR
Description
Automatic subroutine used to run code when a fault occurs on a Galil amplifier. See the TA command and individual amplifier information in the controller user manual.

Arguments
Label must be the first element on a line of code.

Remarks
Use RE to return from the AMPERR subroutine.
See the TA command for more information.

See the AZ command for more information on clearing latched amplifier errors.

Thread 0 does not need to be running for #AMPERR to be executed. This was a requirement on earlier products.

When an external servo driver is used on an axes where the AMP-43000 is also installed, the axis should be setup as a brushed motor (BRm=1), otherwise the lack of hall inputs will cause an amplifier error.

#AUTO
Description
Defines the automatic entry point of embedded DMC code. When power is applied to the controller, or after the controller is reset, the program will automatically begin executing at this label. When no host software is used with the controller, #AUTO is required to run an application program on the controller stand-alone.

Arguments
Label must be the first element on a line of code.

Remarks
Use EN to end the routine
Thread 0 is used to execute #AUTO on startup
The BP command must be used to burn a program into EEPROM for the #AUTO to function.
Examples

#AUTOERR   Bootup Error Automatic Subroutine
Not Burnable Not Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program
#AUTOERR
Description
Automatic subroutine that runs code upon power up if the firmware detects errors. If the EEPROM is corrupted, #AUTOERR will run. The EEPROM is considered corrupt if the checksum calculated on the bytes in the EEPROM do not match the checksum written to the EEPROM.

For SSI and BiSS operation, #AUTOERR will also run if the time to acquire serial position data exceeds 90% of the hardware sample loop. This type of error is very rare and should never occur in normal operation.

Arguments
Label must be the first element on a line of code.

Remarks
Use EN to end the routine
The type of checksum error can be queried with MG_RS
For SSI and BiSS operation
In the event of a serial position acquisition timeout, the following will occur:
The controller will reset
The controller servo loop will not run, TM will be set to zero
TC1 will return "143 TM timed out"
The automatic subroutine #AUTOERR will run, if present
The Error output will be set
When using serial encoders (SSI or BiSS), the #AUTOERR should follow these guidlines
IF _TC=143 do not employ any trippoints in following code because the timer interrupt is suspended
Serial encoders can be disabled with the commands SIn=0 or SSn=0 where n is the axis indicator ABCDEFG or H
In order to re-enable the timer interrupt issue "TM n" where n is the servo update period in us (usually n=1000). See TM for more details

#CMDERR
Description
Automatic subroutine that runs code when a DMC code error occurs. Without #CMDERR defined, if an error (see TC command) occurs in an application program running on the Galil controller, the program (and all threads) will stop.

Arguments
Label must be the first element on a line of code.

Remarks
Use EN to end the routine
#CMDERR will only run from errors generated within embedded DMC code, not from the terminal or host
In a single threaded application (Thread 0 only), the EN command in the #CMDERR routine will restart thread 0 where it left off.
In a multi-threaded application, the thread that has an error will be halted when a command error occurs. Thread 0 will be interrupted to run the #CMDERR routine but other threads will continue to run.
In order to restart the thread that encountered the error, see the example in Chapter 7 of the User Manual and the _ED operand.
Thread 0 does not need to be running in order for the #CMDERR routine to execute.

#COMINT   Communication interrupt automatic subroutine
Not Burnable Not Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program
#COMINT
Description
Automatic subroutine to provide interrupt driven communications from the serial port. #COMINT can be configured by the CI command to run either when any character is received, or when a carriage return is received over the com port. The auxiliary port is used if equipped.

Arguments
Label must be the first element on a line of code.

Remarks
Use EN to end the routine
#COMINT runs in thread 0, and an application must be running in thread 0 in order for #COMINT to be enabled.
Code running in thread zero will be interrupted by the #COMINT subroutine.
It is important to handle the interrupt condition and return without delay. The controller will continue to receive data and update the data operands (P1CH,P2CH, etc) while in #COMINT. This can lead to missed characters, numbers, and strings if #COMINT is unnecessarily delayed.
It is the user's responsiblity to ensure the communication buffer is not filled when in this mode, otherwise the controller will report error code 5 "Input Buffer Full". The buffer on the controller is cleared when either of the two following conditions are met:
A carriage return is recieved on the communication port.
CI -1 is called.

#FWERR   Firmware Error Automatic Subroutine
Not Burnable Not Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program
#FWERR
Description
Automatic subroutine to run when the servo sample overflows. Many features require that the controller perform an action every sample. Running many of these features simultaneously can lead to there not being enough time to complete every action. See remarks for a list of these features. For the majority of applications, this will never occur. This behavior should only occur when running a low sample time (TM) and using absolute encoders with a high number of bits at a low clock frequency.

Arguments
Label must be the first element on a line of code.

Remarks
The following are features, and their associated DMC comands, which add a non-negligible amount of time to the servo sample calculations.
Serial Encoders (SI/SS)
Analog Encoders (AF)
Notch Filter (NF,NZ,NB)
Low Sample Time setting (TM)
Use EN to end the routine.
#FWERR runs on thread 0. Code does not need to be running in thread 0 for #FWERR to be enabled.
_QQ reports a value based on whether the interrupt overflow event has occured. See QQ for more details.
When the servo interrupt overlows, the following will occur:

_QQ is set to 1.
#FWERR, if present, will run.
The notch filter is turned off.
Serial and Analog feedback is disabled.
All axes are aborted (See AB command).
SC will report 41 for all that were profiling.
Examples

#ININT   Input interrupt automatic subroutine
Not Burnable Not Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program
#ININT
Description
The #ININT subroutine is used to execute specific code when inputs specified by the II command are in the desired state.

Arguments
Label must be the first element on a line of code.

Remarks
Use the II command to enable the routine.
Use RI to exit the routine.
To make an unconditional jump from #ININT, there are two methods for re-enabling the interrupt capability
Issue a ZS and then re-issue the command II before the JP
or, use a "null" routine. The "null" routine allows for the execution of the RI command before the unconditional jump. For more information see Application Note #2418, http://www.galil.com/download/application-note/note2418.pdf

#LIMSWI   Limit switch automatic subroutine
Not Burnable Not Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program
#LIMSWI
Description
Automatic sub for running user-defined code on a limit switch event. A limit switch event requires the following conditions.

Motion profiling in the direction of the given limit. I.E. RPm increasing for forward switch, RPm decreasing for reverse switch.
Limit switch toggles active, either a hardware or software limit. See CN for inverting the active sense of the limit swithes.
Without #LIMSWI defined, the controller will issue ST on the axis when its limit switch is tripped during motion in the direction of the switch. With #LIMSWI defined, code is executed in addition to the stop.

In lieu of a controlled stop, the motor can turn off and coast stop in the event of a limit switch event. See OE for this feature.

Arguments
Label must be the first element on a line of code.

Remarks
Use RE to terminate the subroutine
See _LF and _LR for switch state operands
#LIMSWI runs on thread 0. Code does not need to be running in thread 0 for #LIMSWI to be enabled.
LD can be used to disable the limit operation
SD can be used to set the deceleration speed on the limit.

#POSERR   Position error automatic subroutine
Not Burnable Not Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program
#POSERR
Description
Automatic subroutine that runs user code when a position error event occurs. The factory default behavior of the Galil controller upon a position error (_TEn > _ERn) is to drive the error signal low only, turning on the red error LED. If OE is set to 1, the motor whose position error (TE) equals or exceeds its threshold (ER) will be turned off (MO). #POSERR is used to run code upon a position error, for example to notify a host computer.

Arguments
Label must be the first element on a line of code.

Remarks
Use RE to end the routine.
#POSERR runs on thread 0. Code does not need to be running in thread 0 for #POSERR to be enabled.
#POSERR will also run when OE1 is set for an axes and that axis is also setup for encoder failure detection (see OA, OT, OV commands).

#TCPERR   Ethernet communication error automatic subroutine
Not Burnable Not Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program
#TCPERR
Description
Automatic subroutine which allows execution of user code when an TCP error event occurs. #TCPERR allows the application programmer to run code (for example to reestablish the connection) when error code 123 occurs.

Arguments
Label must be the first element on a line of code.

Remarks
Use RE to exit this subroutine.
Error code 123 (TCP lost sync or timeout) occurs when a message is sent out a handle, and no acknowledgement is received.
When this occurs, the handle the message was sent out is closed.
#TCPERR can be used to reestablish the handle

%   Modulo Operator
Not Burnable Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program
n % n
Usage	variable = (value1 % value2)	Performs an operation between two values or evaluated statements
Description
The % symbol is the modulo operator. It takes as arguments any two values, variables, array elements, operands, or At functions (@SIN[]) and returns a value equal to the modulo of the arguments.

Mathmatical operations are calculated left to right rather than multiplication and division calculations performed prior to addition and subraction.
Example:
1+2*3 = 9, not 7

It is recommended that parenthesis be used when more than one mathmatical operation is combined in one command.
Example:
var = ((10*30)+(60/30));' evaluates as 302
var = 10*30+60/30;' evalutes as 12

Arguments

n	-2,147,483,648	-2,147,483,647.9999	N/A	1/65,536	Value to use in modulo operation	
Remarks
This is a binary operator (takes two arguments and returns one value). The result of this operation is a value, which is not valid on its own. It must be coupled with a command. See examples below.

^   JS subroutine stack variable
Not Burnable Not Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program
^s
Description
The ^ character provides local subroutine access for variables passed on the subroutine stack. Passing values on the stack is advanced DMC programming, and is recommended for experienced DMC programmers familiar with the concept of passing arguments by value and by reference.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
s	a	h	N/A	N/A	Stack variable name	a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h supported
Remarks
See the JS command for a full explanation of passing stack variables.
Passing parameters has no type checking, so it is important to exercise good programming style when passing parameters. See examples below for recommended syntax.
Do not use spaces in expressions containing ^.
Global variables MUST be assigned prior to any use in subroutines where variables are passed by reference.
Arrays passed on the stack must have names no longer than 6 chars.
Stack zero has no local-scope variables. Accessing these variables from stack zero writes to stack 1's variable table.

Usage	ACm= n	Arguments specified with a single axis mask and an assignment (=)
AC n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Operands	_ACm	Operand holds the value last set by the command
Description
The Acceleration command (AC) sets the linear acceleration of the motors for independent moves, such as PR, PA, and JG moves. The parameters will be rounded down to the nearest factor of 1024 and have units of counts per second squared.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
m	A	H	N/A	Axis	Axis to assign value	
M	N	N/A	Axis	Virtual axis to assign value	
n	1,024	1,073,740,800	256,000	1,024	Acceleration rate	At TM 1000. Resolution and Min depend on TM, see remarks.
Remarks
The AC command is used to designate acceleration
Specify realistic acceleration rates based on physical system parameters such as:
motor torque rating
loads
amplifier current rating
Specifying an excessive acceleration will cause a large following error during acceleration and the motor will not follow the commanded profile
The acceleration feedforward command (FA) will help minimize the error for aggressive accelerations
Resolution
The Min and Resolution depend on the sampling period of the control loop (TM). The equation to calculate these values is:
Resolution = Min = 1024*(1000/TM)^2
example:
With TM 500 the minimum AC setting and resolution is 4096 counts/second^2
resolution = 1024*(1000/500)^2 = 4096

Usage	ADm= n	Arguments specified with a single axis mask and an assignment (=)
AD n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Description
Trippoint to block command execution until a given distance is traversed. This is a profiled trippoint which means it depends on the motion profiler and not the actual motor encoder. AD can only be used when there is commanded motion on the axis.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
m	A	H	N/A	Axis	Axis to assign value	
n	0	2,147,483,647	N/A	1	Distance of motion	Cannot specify more than 1 argument at a time
Remarks
AD will hold up the execution of the following command until one of the following conditions have been met
The commanded motor position crosses the specified relative distance from the start of the move
The motion profiling on the axis is complete
If in jog (JG) mode, the commanded motion is in the direction which moves away from the specified position
Not valid for a slave during ECAM or Gearing, use MF and MR
If the direction of motion is reversed when in PT mode, the starting position for AD is reinitialized to the position at which the motor is reversed
The AD command is accurate to the number of counts that occur in 2*TM msec
AD command will be affected when the motion smoothing time constant, IT, is not 1. See IT command for further information
AD measures incremental distance from start of move on one axis

AM   After Move
Not Burnable Not Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program Trippoint Variable axis supported
AM mm
Usage	AM mm	Argument is an axis mask
Description
The AM command is a trippoint used to control the timing of events. This command will hold up execution of the following commands until the current move on the specified axis or axes is completed. Any combination of axes or a motion sequence may be specified with the AM command.

For example, AM AB waits for motion on both the A and B axis to be complete. AM with no parameter specifies that motion on all axes to be complete.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
mm	A	ABCDEFGH	ABCDEFGH	Multi-Axis Mask	Axes to wait for profiled motion to complete	
S	T	N/A	Multi-Axis Mask	Vector plane to wait for profiled motion to complete	
Remarks
AM is a very important command for controlling the timing between multiple move sequences.
For example, if the A-axis is in the middle of a position relative move (PR) you cannot make a position absolute move (PAA, BGA) until the first move is complete. Use AMA to halt the program sequence until the first profiled motion is complete.
AM tests for profile completion only. The actual motor may still be moving. To halt the program sequence until the actual physical motion has completed, use the MC command.
To test motion complete without halting the program sequence, use the operand _BGn, which will be zero when profiled motion is complete (see BG command).

AZ   Clear Latched Amplifier Errors
Burnable Valid in terminal Not Valid while in motion Valid in program
AZ n
Operands	_AZ2
Operand has special meaning, see Remarks
Description
The AZ command is used to enable enhanced error reporting and clear any latched amplifier errors. When using certain amplifiers, error conditions will stay active until cleared. This persistent error state is defined as a latched error.

Arguments
Argument	Value	Details
n	1	Clear latched amplifier errors.
2	Enable Enhanced Error Clearing.
Issue AZ2 to enable enhanced error reporting.

When all axes are in a motor off state (MO) and there are no latched errors, amplifier errors will be reported live by the TA command.

While an axis is in a servo here state (SH), the following amplifier errors will latch:

Over-Current
Over-Temperature
Under-Voltage
ELO
NOTE: The Over-Voltage amplifier error does not latch. While the amplifier is in an Over-Voltage condition, the amplifier will short the motor phases resulting in a drag being felt on the motor.

To clear latched amplifier errors, issue MO followed by AZ1.

Remarks
_AZ2 contains a 0 if the amplifier is in normal error reporting.
_AZ2 contains a 1 if the amplifier is in enhanced error reporting
Refer to the controller User Manual for more information on clearing amplifier errors.

Usage	BRm= n	Arguments specified with a single axis mask and an assignment (=)
BR n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Operands	_BRm	Operand holds the value last set by the command
Description
The BR command configures the motor configuration and type for an axis.

The BR command is used with internal Galil amplifiers to enable which axes will be set as brush-type servos or to configure the firmware to use external drives instead of the internal channel.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
m	A	H	N/A	Axis	Axis to assign value	
Argument	Value	Description	Notes
n	-1	Configured for external drive	Use for external drives with internal sine amps -D3640, -D3540 and -D3520
0	Configured for Brushless servo	Default
1	Configured for Brush-type servo	Use for axes with external drives on -D3040 and -D3020 to avoid hall errors
Remarks
If an axis has Off-On-Error(OE) set to 1, an amplifier error will occur on an axis if there are no halls and BR is set to 0. Set BR to 1 to avoid an amplifier error state.
The hall error bits cannot cause #AMPERR events if an axis is configured as brush-type.
On axes with an internal amplifier present, when BR1 is set the hall inputs are available for general use via the QH command.
Note: If the controller has been previously configured with the BA command for sinusoidal commutation with a Galil internal amplifier, the command "BA N" must be issued prior to setting the axis to brushed mode.
Examples
'Galil DMC Code Example
BR 1,0,0;'     Sets X-axis to brush-type, Y and Z to brushless

BV   Burn Variables and Array
Not Burnable Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program
BV
Usage	BV	Command takes no arguments
Operands	_BV
Operand has special meaning, see Remarks
Description
The BV command saves the controller variables and arrays in non-volatile EEPROM memory. This command typically takes up to 2 seconds to execute and must not be interrupted. The controller returns a : when the Burn is complete.

Arguments
The BV command has no arguments

Remarks
_BV returns the number of controller axes.
This command will store the ECAM table values in non-volatile EEPROM memory.
This command may cause the Galil software to timeout. This warning is normal and is designed to warn the user when the controller does not respond to a command within the timeout period. This occurs because this command takes more time than the default timeout period. The timeout can be changed in the Galil software. This warning does not affect the operation of the board or software.
Issuing this command will pause the output of the Data Record until the command is completed.

BW   Brake Wait
Burnable Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program Variable axis supported
BWm= n
BW n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n
Usage	BWm= n	Arguments specified with a single axis mask and an assignment (=)
BW n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Operands	_BWm	Operand holds the value last set by the command
Description
The BW command sets the delay between when the brake is turned on (1) and when the amp is turned off (2). When the controller goes into a motor-off (MO) state, this is the time (in samples) between when the brake digital output changes state and when the amp enable digital output changes state. The brake is actuated immediately upon MO and the delay is to account for the time it takes for the brake to engage mechanically once it is energized electrically. The brake is released immediately upon SH.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
m	A	H	N/A	Axis	Axis to assign value	
n	0	4,096	0	1	Specify brake wait time, in samples.	0 = Turn brake function off
Remarks
The Brake Wait does not apply when the motor is shut off due to OE1 (Off on Error). In this case (position error exceeded or Abort triggered) the motor off and brake output will be applied simultaneously.
SB,CB and OP have no effect on outputs mapped to BW. In order to toggle brake outputs without engaging the servo (e.g. for maintenance), set BWm=0 and then use SB and CB as necessary.
The state of the output configured as a brake cannot be querried with the @OUT[] command.
Outputs 1-8 are used for Axes A-H, where output 1 is the brake for axis A and output 2 is the brake for axis B and so on.
When using the brake outputs, it is recommended to order the controller with 500mA sourcing output option (HSRC).

BXm= n
BX< o
Usage	BXm= n	Arguments specified with a single axis mask and an assignment (=)
Operands	_BXm	Operand has special meaning, see Remarks
Description
The BX command uses a method to initialize an axis with limited movement of the motor. It is expected to move no more than 10 degrees of the magnetic cycle. The last stage of the BX command will lock the motor into the nearest 15 degree increment. In addition to BX , the BA and BM commands must be used to initialize the axis for sinusoidal commutation.

Arguments

Remarks
GDK's Step-By-Step tool can be utilized for automatic setup and configuration of brushless motor with Galil internal sinusoidal amplifiers.
_BXm contains 0 if axis m is not a sinusoidal axis, contains 1 if axis m is an uninitialized sinusoidal axis, and contains 3 if axis m is an initialized sinusoidal axis
The BX command may be given while the motor is off.
While the BX command is executing, DMC code, data records, and communication from the controller will pause until completion.
BX initialization is only valid with Galil internal sinusoidal amplifiers.
There are several methods to initialize Galil's internal amplifiers for sinusoidal commutation. They are listed below:
Initialization of a Galil Sinusoidal Amplifier
Command	Description	Notes
BI/BC	Uses hall sensors to estimate the commutation angle until a hall transition can be used to set the commutation angle precisely.	This is the recommended method if hall sensors are present.
BZ	Commands the axis to a specific commutation angle.	This is the recommended method if hall sensors are not present.
BX	Uses an algorithm to determine the commutation angle with minimal motion.	Should only be used if minimal motion is required during intialization and no hall sensors are present.
BX Initialization Steps
Specify the axis/axes for sinusoidal initialization with the BA command.
Specify the number of encoder counts per magnetic cycle of the motor with the BM command.
Set the desired hold time BX<o.
Initialize using BX command with n <= n max .
The motor is now fully initialized for sinusoidal commutation.

Remarks
GDK's Step-By-Step tool can be utilized for automatic setup and configuration of brushless motor with Galil internal sinusoidal amplifiers.
The BZ hold times should be lengthened to ensure that any oscillations introduced by the BZ command fully settle in order to accurately set the commutation angle.
The o and p parameters can be interrogated with BZ <? and BZ >? respectively.
The BZ command may be given when the motor is off.
_BZm contains the un-signed distance in encoder counts from the motor's current position to the position of magnetic zero for the specified axis.
The value is only vaild after succesfully initializing with BZ.
While the BZ command is executing, DMC code, data records, and communication from the controller will pause until completion.
Use equation below to determine the maximum n paramete where Im (in Amps) is the continuous current rating of the motor and G is the current gain of the amplifier (in Amps/Volt).
A conservative starting point for the BX command is 0.5* n max but may be increased up to n max as needed.

CDm= n
CD n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n=t
Usage	CDm= n	Arguments specified with a single axis mask and an assignment (=)
CD n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Description
The CD command specifies the incremental position on contour axes. This command is used only in the Contour Mode (CM). The incremental position will be executed over the time period specified by the command DT (ranging from 2 to 256 servo updates)

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
m	A	H	N/A	Axis	Axis to assign value	
n	-32,768	32,767	0	1	Contour position segment	Incremental position move
t	1	8	0	1	Time override option	t = 1-8 specifies 2^n samples for the given interval.
0	0	0	0	Time override option	t=0 with n=0 disables Contour mode. See Remarks
-1	-1	0	0	Time override option	Pauses contour buffer at the segment with t=-1. Reissue DT to re-engage contour mode.
Remarks
The units of the command are in encoder counts.
The = operator can be used to override the global DT time by transmitting the time in a CD with the position data.
n=t=0 terminates Contour mode similar to VE or LE for vector mode and linear interpolation mode.
Example. CMBC is terminated with CD 0,0=0.
The user must have a space after CD in order to terminate the Contour Mode correctly.
The command CD0=0 (no space) will assign a variable CD0 the value of 0 rather than terminate Contour mode.

Usage	CEm= n	Arguments specified with a single axis mask and an assignment (=)
CE n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Operands	_CEm	Operand holds the value last set by the command
Description
The CE command configures the encoder to quadrature type or pulse and direction type. It also allows inverting the polarity of the encoders which reverses the direction of the feedback. The configuration applies independently to the main axes encoders and the auxiliary encoders.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
m	A	H	N/A	Axis	Axis to assign value	
n	0	15	0	1	Encoder configuration setting	n is the sum of 2 integers M and N which configure main and auxiliary encoders. See table below for configuration description.
Configure Encoder Types. Add value from Column 1 and Column 2 to make n
Column 1	Main Encoder Type	Column 2	Auxiliary Encoder Type
0	Normal quadrature	0	Normal quadrature
1	Normal pulse and direction	4	Normal pulse and direction
2	Reversed quadrature	8	Reversed quadrature
3	Reversed pulse and direction	12	Reversed pulse and direction
For example: n = 10 implies 2 + 8, thus both encoders are reversed quadrature.

Remarks
When using a servo motor, changing the CE type can cause the motor to run away.
When the MT command is configured for a stepper motor, the auxiliary encoder (used to count stepper pulses) will be forced to pulse and direction.
When using pulse and direction encoders, the pulse signal is connected to CHA and the direction signal is connected to CHB.

CF   Configure Unsolicited Messages Handle
Not Burnable Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program
CF m
Usage	CF mm	Argument is an axis mask
Operands	_CF
Operand has special meaning, see Remarks
Description
The CF command sets the port for unsolicited messages. The CF command directs the controller to send unsolicited responses to the Main or Aux Serial Port (If equipped), or to an Ethernet handle. An unsolicited message is data generated by the controller which is not in response to a command sent by the host.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
m	A	H	S	Handle	Ethernet Handle to assign as unsolicited message port	See Remarks
I	I	S	Handle	Set the port that sent the command as the unsolicited message port	Not valid in program
S	T	S	Handle	Set serial port as unsolicited message port	m=S is Main serial port. m=T is Aux Serial port
Remarks
Examples of application code commands that will generate unsolicited messages follow.
'Galil DMC Code Example

var=?;'          A variable interogation
var=;'           "
thisIsAnError;'  A dmc error will generate an error message 
Ethernet Handle as Unsolicited Message Port
When communicating over Ethernet, two Ethernet handles should be used:
1.) The first handle should be used for command-and-response traffic. This is the primary handle that the host uses to communicate to the controller.
2.) The second handle should be used for unsolicited traffic. This is the primary handle that the controller uses to asynchronously communicate to the host. Use CF to point unsolicited traffic to this handle.
It is NOT recommended to use one Ethernet handle for both command-and-response, and unsolicited messages.
Operand Usage
_CF contains the decimal value of the ASCII letter where unsolicited messages are currently routed.
Examples

Not Burnable Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program
CI n
Usage	CI n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Description
The CI command configures program interrupts based on input of characters over the communication port.

The command configures a program interrupt based on characters received on communications port 2, the AUX serial port. An interrupt causes program flow to jump to the #COMINT subroutine. If multiple program threads are used, the #COMINT subroutine runs in thread 0 and the remaining threads continue to run without interruption. The characters received can be accessed via the operands P2CH, P2ST, P2NM, P2CD.

Arguments

n	-1	Clear interrupt data buffer	
0	Do not interrupt	Default
1	Interrupt on carriage return	
2	Interrupt on any character	
Remarks
For more, see Operator Data Entry Mode in the user manual.
It is the user's responsiblity to ensure the communication buffer is not filled when in this mode, otherwise the controller will report error code 5 "Input Buffer Full". The buffer on the controller is cleared when either of the two following conditions are met:
A carriage return is recieved on the communication port.
CI -1 is called.

CW   Copyright information and Data Adjustment bit on/off
Burnable Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program
CW n0,n1
Usage	CW n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Description
The CW command will return the copyright information when the argument, n, is 0 or is omitted. Otherwise, the CW command is used as a communications enhancement for use by the Galil terminal software programs. When turned on, the most significant bit of unsolicited ASCII characters is set to 1. Unsolicited ASCII characters are characters that are returned from a program running on the controller (usually from the MG command). This command does not affect solicited characters, which are characters that are returned as a response to a command sent from a host PC (e.g. TP).

Arguments
Argument	Value	Description	Notes
n0	0	Causes controller to return a copyright information string	Equivalent to n0 = ?
1	Controller will set the MSB of unsolicited message characters	
2	Controller will not set the MSB of unsolicited message characters	Default. Must be set when viewing unsolicited messages from non-Galil software
n1	0	Controller will set error code 131 when hardware handshaking disables character transmissions	Serial timeout will cause long code execution time.
1	Controller will not set error code 131 when hardware handshaking disables character transmissions	Default. Data will be lost if the receiving hardware doesn't service the hardware handshaking lines.
Remarks
Galil software packages automatically sends CW 1 during connection to a controller.
If reading unsolicited data through a non-Galil software (eg. Hyperterminal), issue CW 2
Operand Usage
_CW contains the value set for n0
_CW4 contains the value set for n1
Examples
'Galil DMC Code Example

Not Burnable Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program
DA str,str,...
Usage	DA n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Operands	_DAm	Operand has special meaning, see Remarks
Description
The DA command frees the array and/or variable memory space. In this command, more than one array or variable can be specified for memory de-allocation. Different arrays and variables are separated by comma when specified in one command.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
str	1 char	8 chars	N/A	String	Array name to deallocate	If str = *, deallocate all arrays
1 char	8 chars	N/A	String	Variable name to deallocate	If str = *, deallocate all variables
where
str[] - Defined array name
str - Defined variable name
str = * deallocates all the variables
str = *[] - Deallocates all the arrays

Remarks
_DA contains the total number of arrays available.
DA ? returns the total number of arrays available.
Since this command deallocates the spaces and compacts the array spaces in the memory it is possible that execution of this command may take longer time than a standard command.
Variables and arrays that are deallocated are not set to zero. A routine that writes zeros to the array and/or variables should be created if this is desired.
Examples
'Galil DMC Code Example
'Cars' and 'Salesmen' are arrays, and 'Total' is a variable.
DM Cars[40],Salesmen[50];'        Dimension 2 arrays

Usage	DC m= n	Arguments specified with a single axis mask and an assignment (=)
DC n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Operands	_DC m	Operand holds the value last set by the command
Description
The Deceleration command (DC) sets the linear deceleration of the motors for independent moves such as PR, PA, and JG moves. The parameters will be rounded down to the nearest factor of 1024 and have units of counts per second squared.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
m	A	H	N/A	Axis	Axis to assign value	
M	N	N/A	Axis	Virtual axis to assign value	
n	1,024	1,073,740,800	256,000	1,024	Deceleration rate	At TM 1000. See Remarks for resolution details.
Remarks
The AC command is used to designate acceleration
Specify realistic deceleration rates based on physical system parameters such as:
motor torque rating
loads
amplifier current rating
Specifying an excessive deceleration will cause a large following error during deceleration and the motor will not follow the commanded profile
DC may be changed during a move in Jog mode, but not in a PA or PR move
However, directly following an axis stop (i.e. ST m or a limit switch), the DC value of a PA or PR move may be changed while the axis is still decelerating
Resolution
The resolution of the DC command is dependent on the sampling period of the control loop (TM). With the default rate of TM 1000 the resolution is 1024 counts/second^2. The equation to calculate the resolution of the DC command is:
resolution = min = 1024*(1000/TM)^2
Example:
With TM 500 the minimum DC setting and resolution is 4096 counts/second^2.
resolution = 1024*(1000/500)^2 = 4096

Usage	DEm= n	Arguments specified with a single axis mask and an assignment (=)
DE n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Operands	_DEm	Operand has special meaning, see Remarks
Description
The DE command defines the position of the auxiliary (dual) encoders.

Dual encoders are useful when you need an encoder on the motor and on the load. The encoder on the load is typically the auxiliary encoder and is used to verify the true load position. Any error in load position is used to correct the motor position.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes

n	-2,147,483,648	2,147,483,647	0	1	Position set for auxiliary encoders	For MT 1,-1,1.5,-1.5
-2,147,483,648	2,147,483,647	0	1	Position set for main encoders	For MT 2,-2,2.5,-2.5
Remarks
When using stepper motors, the DE command defines the main encoder position.
The auxiliary encoders are not available for the stepper axis or for any axis where output compare is active.
The operand _DEm, as well as _TDm, holds the current aux encoder position.
n=? will return the encoder position, as returned by TD.

-2,147,483,648	2,147,483,647	0	1	Value assigned to step/commanded position (RP and TD registers)	For MT 2,-2,2.5,-2.5
Remarks
The DP command sets the commanded reference position for axes configured as steppers. The units are in steps.
Example: "DP 0" This will set the registers for TD and RP to zero, but will not effect the TP register value. When equipped with an encoder, use the DE command to set the encoder position for stepper mode.
The DP command is useful to redefine the absolute position.
For example, you can manually position the motor by hand using the Motor Off command, MO. Turn the servo motors back on with SH and then use DP0 to redefine the new position as your absolute zero.
The operand _DPm, as well as _TPm, holds the current main encoder position.
n=? will return the encoder position, as returned by TP.

DT   Delta Time
Not Burnable Valid in terminal Not Valid while in motion Valid in program
DT n
Usage	DT n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Description
The DT command sets the time interval for Contour Mode. The time interval is 2N samples. With TM 1000, there are 1024 samples per second.

Sending the DT command once will set the time interval for all contour data until a new DT command (or CDm=n) is sent.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
n	1	8	0	1	Set time interval for contour mode in 2^n samples.	
-1	-1	N/A	0	n=-1 to pause the contour mode	See Remarks.
Remarks
By default the sample period is 1 msec (set by the TM command); with n=1, the time interval would be 2 msec
n = -1 allows a pre-load of the contour buffer or to asynchronously pause the contour buffer. DT-1 during contour mode will pause the contour buffer (and commanded movement).
A positive DT will resume contour mode from paused position of buffer.
DT can be overridden with the =t parameter within a CD segment.
Examples
'Galil DMC Code Example
:DT 4;'              Specifies time interval to be 16 msec (TM1000)

DV   Dual Velocity (Dual Loop)
Burnable Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program Variable axis supported
DVm= n
DV n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n
Usage	DVm= n	Arguments specified with a single axis mask and an assignment (=)
DV n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Operands	_DVm	Operand holds the value last set by the command
Description
The DV function changes the operation of the PID filter. When DV is enabled the KD (derivative) term operates on the auxiliary encoder instead of the main encoder.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
m	A	H	N/A	Axis	Axis to assign value	
n	0	1	0	1	State of dual loop mode	n = 0 disables Dual loop. n = 1 enables Dual loop
Remarks
The DV command is useful in backlash and resonance compensation.
DV must be set properly for commutation to be successful with internal sine drives.
When DVm=0, the controller will use the main encoder for sine drive commutation.
When DVm=1, the controller will use the aux encoder for sine drive commutation.
Correcting for Positive Feedback
With motor off (MO) check the motor encoder with TD and load encoder with TP. Manually move the motor/load and reissue the TD and TP commands to confirm both encoders count in the same direction.
If the encoders count in opposing directions, change the polarity of one encoder using the CE command or by changing the wiring. Consult user manual.
If positive feedback still persists, switch the motor polarity or reverse the direction of both encoders.
Off on error (OE) and error limits (ER) can be used to shut down the motor in the event of a runaway.
Using DV with Large motor/load encoder ratio
When using Dual Loop mode with a large motor:load ratio and/or running at high velocities where low position error at speed is required, FV should be used to compensate for the derivative contribution from the higher resolution motor encoder.
The estimated FV setting required to compensate for the derivative contribution can be calculated by the equation:
FV = (KD/4)*(motor/load)
motor/load = effective motor to load ratio
For example: KD = 200, motor encoder changes 5000 counts per 1000 counts of load encoder (motor/load = 5/1)
FV = (200/4)*(5/1) = 250

FE   Find Edge
Not Burnable Valid in terminal Not Valid while in motion Valid in program Variable axis supported
FE mm
Usage	FE mm	Argument is an axis mask
Description
The FE command moves a motor until a transition is seen on the home input for that axis. The direction of motion depends on the initial state of the homing input (use the CN command to configure the polarity of the home input). Once the transition is detected, the motor decelerates to a stop.
This command is useful for creating custom homing sequences.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
mm	A	ABCDEFGH	N/A	Multi-Axis Mask	Axes to Find Edge	
Remarks
Find Edge only searches for a change in state on the Home Input. Use FI (Find Index) to search for the encoder index. Use HM (Home) to search for both the Home input and the Index.
Remember to specify BG after each of these commands
Speed of Find Edge is set with the SP command and should be low enough to allow for a minimum of a 2 sample period pulse width on the home signal. With TM 1000, the pulse width must be at least 2ms.
Direction of Travel
_CN1 value	Home input digital state	_HMn state	Direction of travel if FE begun in this state

Description
The FI and BG commands move the motor until an encoder index pulse is detected.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
mm	A	ABCDEFGH	N/A	Multi-Axis Mask	Axes to Find Index	
Remarks
The controller looks for a transition from low to high. There are 2 stages to the FI command. The first stage jogs the motor at the speed and direction of the JG command until a transition is detected on the index line. When the transition is detected, the position is latched and the motor will decelerate to a stop. In the second stage, the motor will reverse direction and move to the latched position of the index pulse at the speed set by the HV command. At the conclusion of FI, the position is defined as zero.
Find Index only searches for a change in state on the Index. Use FE to search for the Home. Use HM (Home) to search for both the Home input and the Index. Remember to specify BG after each of these commands.

Usage	GAm0= m	Arguments are single axis masks and are specified with a single axis mask and an assignment (=)
GA m ...	Arguments are single axis masks specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Description
The GA command specifies the master axes for electronic gearing. Multiple masters for gearing may be specified. A slave axis may have only one master. The masters may be the main encoder input, auxiliary encoder input, or the commanded position of any axis. The master may also be the commanded vector move in a coordinated motion of LM or VM type. When the master is a simple axis, it may move in any direction and the slave follows. When the master is a commanded vector move, the vector move is considered positive and the slave will move forward if the gear ratio is positive, and backward if the gear ratio is negative. The slave axes and ratios are specified with the GR command and gearing is turned off by the command GR0.

Remarks
m=? returns the GA setting
When gearing is used in a gantry application, gearing off of the commanded position is recommended
When an axis is geared to a master axis, the slave's geared profile will be superimposed to the slave's commanded profile
Gearing is disabled in the following conditions:
The gear ratio is set to 0
A limit switch is reached
The axis is commanded to stop with the ST command
If it is desired that gearing is not disabled when a limit switch is reached or an ST command is issued, enable Gantry Mode (GM command).

HM   Home
Not Burnable Valid in terminal Not Valid while in motion Valid in program Variable axis supported
HM mm
Usage	HM mm	Argument is an axis mask
Operands	_HMm	Operand has special meaning, see Remarks
Description
The HM command performs a three stage homing sequence for servo systems and a two stage sequence for stepper motors.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
mm	A	ABCDEFGH	ABCDEFGH	Multi-Axis Mask	Axis to perform Homing Routine	No argument homes all axes
Remarks
The HM command is derived of FE and FI commands. Custom homing sequences can be created by using the FE (Find Edge) and FI (Find Index) commands.
The sequence of FE and FI commands varies depending upon if the axis is configured for a stepper or servo
Step One. Servos and Steppers
During the first stage of the homing sequence, the motor moves at the user-programmed speed until detecting a transition on the homing input for that axis. The speed for step one is set with the SP command.
The direction for this first stage is determined by the initial state of the homing input. The state of the homing input can be configured using the second field of the CN command.
Once the homing input changes state, the motor decelerates to a stop.
Step Two. Servos and Steppers
At the second stage, the motor changes directions and approaches the transition again at the speed set with the HV command. When the transition is detected, the motor is stopped instantaneously.
Step Three. Servos only
At the third stage, the motor moves in the positive direction at the speed set with the HV command until it detects an index pulse via latch from the encoder. It returns to the latched position and defines it as position 0.
Operand

_IA5
Operand has special meaning, see Remarks
Description
The IA command assigns the controller IP address and the TCP time out. The IP address can also be assigned via Galil software or from an external server.

The controller defaults to DHCP and will receive an IP address from a DHCP server if present. To manually set an IP address over the serial connection, send DH0 to disable DHCP prior to setting the new IP address with IA.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
n0	0	255	0	1	Byte 3 of the IP address	
n1	0	255	0	1	Byte 2 of the IP address

o	1	2,147,483,647	250	1	The time in update samples between TCP retries	Up to 5 retries occur
Remarks
When specifying the IP address with IA, remember to use commas as delimeters instead of periods.
n4 = ? will return the IP address of the controller in comma seperated format.
Setting the IP address over Ethernet to a new value will cause an immediate disconnect/timeout. Reconnect to the controller on the new IP address and issue a BN to save the new value to flash.
To change the IP address manually over Ethernet on a controller which was initially assigned via DHCP, send "DH 0;IA n0,n1,n2,n3" as one command line. Reconnect on the new IP and issue BN to save.
Operands
_IA0 contains the IP address representing a 32 bit signed number (Two's complement). See the example below.
_IA1 contains the value for o (retry time).
_IA2 contains the number of available handles.
_IA3 contains the number of the handle using this operand where the number is 0 to 7. 0 represents handle A, 1 handle B, etc. This is used by a remote device to detect its outgoing handle (see WH).
_IA4 contains the number of the handle that lost communication last, contains a -1 on reset to indicate no handles lost.
_IA5 returns autonegotiation Ethernet speed. Returns 10 for 10-Base T and returns 100 for 100-Base T, it will return -1 if there is no physical link.

-3	-1	N/A	1	Specify the connection type to close when closing a handle	See Remarks
Remarks
All 4 bytes must be assigned for an IP address to be valid.
IHm=? returns the IP address as 4, 1-byte numbers.
Use the following equation to change the 4 byte IP (n0,n1,n2,n3) to a single 32 bit number, n.
n = (n0*2^24) + (n1*2^16) + (n2*2^8) + n3.
When using Modbus, port 502, note that Galil Modbus supports one master per slave.
Opening a Handle
To open a handle, the user must specify:
The IP address of the slave.
(optional) The port number of the slave. If not specified, the firmware will choose a port.
(optional)The connection type as TCP/IP or UDP/IP. If not specified, the controller will make a TCP connection.
Issue the IH command on an available handle with the correct settings for IP (n0-n3), port (o) and connection type (p).
See TH to list handle status.
Modbus connections must always be specified as port 502.
Closing a Handle
Closing multiple handles is done with the T handle identifier along with a connection type p selector.
IHT => p closes all handles matching the p type selector, where p = -1 closes UDP handles, p = -2 closes TCP handles and p = -3 closes all handle types.
Closing individual handles, other than the handle being used to send the IH command, is done with IHN => -1 where n is the handle to close (A-H).
Closing the handle that sent the command is done with the S handle identifier, along with connection type p selector.
IHS => p closes the handle that sent the command if its type matches the p selector,where p = -1 closes UDP handles, p = -2 closes TCP handles and p = -3 closes all handle types.

Description
The IH command is used when the controller is operated as a master (client) to open a handle and connect to a slave (server).

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
m	A	H	N/A	Handle	Handle to assign connection	
S	T	N/A	Handle	Special handle designator used when closing handles	See Remarks
n0	0	255	0	1	Byte 3 of the slave IP address	
n1	0	255	0	1	Byte 2 of the slave IP address	
n2	0	255	0	1	Byte 1 of the slave IP address	
n3	0	255	0	1	Byte 0 of the slave IP address	
n4	-2,147,483,648	2,147,483,647	0	1	Slave IP address as a 32 bit value	
o	0	65,535	see Notes	1	Specify the slave port to connect over	If o is omitted, the controller selects the port starting at 1000
p	1	2	2	1	Specify the connection type to open	n = 2 is TCP. n = 1 is UDP.
-3	-1	N/A	1	Specify the connection type to close when closing a handle	See Remarks
Remarks
All 4 bytes must be assigned for an IP address to be valid.
IHm=? returns the IP address as 4, 1-byte numbers.
Use the following equation to change the 4 byte IP (n0,n1,n2,n3) to a single 32 bit number, n.
n = (n0*2^24) + (n1*2^16) + (n2*2^8) + n3.
When using Modbus, port 502, note that Galil Modbus supports one master per slave.
Opening a Handle
To open a handle, the user must specify:
The IP address of the slave.
(optional) The port number of the slave. If not specified, the firmware will choose a port.
(optional)The connection type as TCP/IP or UDP/IP. If not specified, the controller will make a TCP connection.
Issue the IH command on an available handle with the correct settings for IP (n0-n3), port (o) and connection type (p).
See TH to list handle status.
Modbus connections must always be specified as port 502.
Closing a Handle
Closing multiple handles is done with the T handle identifier along with a connection type p selector.
IHT => p closes all handles matching the p type selector, where p = -1 closes UDP handles, p = -2 closes TCP handles and p = -3 closes all handle types.
Closing individual handles, other than the handle being used to send the IH command, is done with IHN => -1 where n is the handle to close (A-H).
Closing the handle that sent the command is done with the S handle identifier, along with connection type p selector.
IHS => p closes the handle that sent the command if its type matches the p selector,where p = -1 closes UDP handles, p = -2 closes TCP handles and p = -3 closes all handle types.

II   Input Interrupt
Burnable Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program
II n0,n1,n2,n3
Usage	II n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Description
The II command enables the input interrupt function for the specified inputs.

The II command is used along with the #ININT subroutine to execute specific code when inputs specified by II are in the desired state.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
n0	0	8	0	1	Lowest input to use for interrupt trigger	n0=0 disables input interrupt
n1	1	8	N/A	1	Highest input to use for interrupt trigger	n1 must be >= n0, If omitted n1=n0
n2	1	255	N/A	1	Use bitmask as alternative selection of input interrupt triggers	If n0 and n1 are used, n2 is ignored, see Remarks
n3	0	255	0	1	Bitmask specifying required input state for interrupt trigger	Default=interrupt triggers on low inputs, see Remarks
Remarks
The argument n2 is a bitmask for the inputs selected for the input interrupt function. This field is ignored if n0 and n1 are used.
For example, if n2 = 15, the binary equivalent is 00001111. This means that inputs 1-4 would be selectd by the II function, and 5-8 would not be.
This argument n3 is bistmask showing which state the input must be in for the II function to trigger.
For example, if n0=1 and n1=4, the inputs 1,2,3 and 4 have been activated. If the value for n3 is 2 (the binary equivalent of 2 is 00000010), then input 2 must be a '1' and inputs 1,3, and 4 must be a "0", for II to trigger the #ININT subroutine.
The RI command is used to return from the #ININT routine.

Usage	ILm= n	Arguments specified with a single axis mask and an assignment (=)
IL n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Operands	_ILm	Operand holds the value last set by the command
Description
The IL command limits the effect of the integrator gain in the filter to a certain voltage.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
m	A	H	N/A	Axis	Axis to assign value	
n	-9.9982	9.9982	9.9982	20/65,536	Value of Integrator limit in volts	n< 0 (negative value) freezes the effect of the integrator during the move
Remarks
IL is the absolute value of the integrator limit. For example:
ILA= 2 limits the output of the integrator of the A-axis to the +/-2 Volt range.
KD and KP terms remain active in any case. The output from the KD and KP terms is not affected.
A negative parameter will freeze the effect of the integrator during the move. For Example:
ILA= -3 limits the integrator output of the A axis to +/-3V but freezes the contribution of the Integrator loop during motion.
If, at the start of the motion, the integrator output is 1.6 Volts, that level will be maintained through the move and the integrator will not accumulate during the move.
Once the profiled move has completed (RP has reached final commanded position), the integrator loop will be enabled.
When using the -CER firmware, the default value of IL is -9.9982.

The IP command has four effects depending on the mode of motion being executed.
IP operation based upon modes of motion
Case	Equivalent Commands	Description
Motor is standing still	IPm=n Equivalent to PRm=n;BGm	Motor will move to specified position with the predefined AC,DC,SP values.
Motor is moving toward position n	PRm=n0; BGm;IPm=n1 Equivalent to PRm= (n0+n1); BGm	Motor will move a relative move of (n0+n1).
Motor is in Jog Mode	JGm=n0;BGm;IPm=n1 Equivalent to Continuing jog from (current position + n1)	The motor will instantly try to servo to a position which is the current instantaneous position plus the specified IP position. SP and AC parameters have no effect. This command is useful when synchronizing 2 axes in which one of the axis' speed is indeterminate due to a variable diameter pulley.
Motor is a slave in gearing mode	GAm= m0; GRm=n0; IPm=n1 Equivalent to GAm= m0; GRm=n0; PRm=n1; BGm	The motor will move with the predefined AC,DC,SP values superimposed on top of the existing gearing motion.

IT   Independent Time Constant - Smoothing Function
Burnable Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program Variable axis supported
ITm= n
IT n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n
Usage	ITm= n	Arguments specified with a single axis mask and an assignment (=)
IT n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Operands	_ITm	Operand holds the value last set by the command
Description
The IT command filters the acceleration and deceleration functions of independent moves such as JG, PR, PA to produce a smooth velocity profile. The resulting profile, known as smoothing, has continuous acceleration and results in reduced mechanical vibrations. IT sets the bandwidth of the filter where 1 means no filtering and 0.004 means maximum filtering.

The IT command also filters the individual axes during Vector Mode (VM) and Linear Interpolation Mode (LM).

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
m	A	H	N/A	Axis	Axis to assign value	
n	0.004	1	1	1/256	Value of independent smoothing function	1 = no filtering, 0.004 = maximum filtering
Remarks
The IT filtering results in longer motion time.
The use of IT will not effect the trippoints AR and AD.
The trippoints AR & AD monitor the profile prior to the IT filter and therefore can be satisfied before the actual distance has been reached if IT is NOT 1.
Details on the IT filtering can be found in Application Note #3412

Description
The JG command sets the jog mode and the jog slew speed of the axes.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
m	A	H	N/A	Axis	Axis to assign value

Remarks
When jogging, the motion controller profiles a continuous move at the commanded speed.
To stop the motion, use the ST command.
JG 2 is the minimum non-zero speed
_JGm contains the absolute value of the jog speed for the specified axis.
The JG command will set the SP register with the absolute value of the 'n' value.
Resolution
The resolution of the JG command is dependent upon the update rate setting (TM).
With the default rate of TM 1000 the resolution is 2 cnts/second.
The equation to calculate the resolution of the JG command is:
resolution = 2*(1000/TM)
example:
With TM 250 the resolution of the JG command is 8 cnts/second
resolution = 2*(1000/250) = 8

JP   Jump to Program Location
Not Burnable Not Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program
JP #str,(ex)
JP n,(ex)
Usage	JP n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Description
The JP command causes a jump to a program location on a specified condition. The program location may be any program line number or label. A jump is taken if the specified condition is true. Multiple conditions can be used in a single jump statement.

JP can be used for relative jumps and for jump tables, see Examples.

Arguments

ex	N/A	N/A	N/A	Expression	Conditional statement/s that must evaluate true for jump to occur	If omitted, JP automatically evaluates as true
Remarks
The logical operators that can be used in the conditional statement are:
< less than
> greater than
= equal to
<= less than or equal to
>= greater than or equal to
<> not equal to
The conditional statements are combined in pairs using the operands "&" and "|".
The "&" operand between any two conditions requires that both statements must be true for the combined statement to be true.
The "|" operand between any two conditions requires that only one statement be true for the combined statement to be true.
Each condition must be placed in parentheses for proper evaluation by the controller.

Remarks
JS can be nested, called up to 16 deep
When used after JS is called, the _JS operand contains the returned value of the subroutine called by JS
Basic Usage
The JS command will change the sequential order of execution of commands in a program
If the jump is taken, program execution will continue at the line specified by the destination parameter, which can be either a line number or label. A variable holding a line number or an expression resulting in the calculation of a line number can also be used
The line number of the calling JS command is saved and after an EN command is encountered (End of subroutine), program execution will continue with the instruction following the calling JS command.
A jump is taken if the specified condition is true. Each condition must be placed in parenthesis for proper evaluation by the controller.
Code flexibility/reuse. A single subroutine can be written and called many times and from various locations in code. The stack "remembers" where to return when completed. This is opposite from a "blind jump" (JP).
Conditional Syntax
Condition	Validity
JS#A,(var1=0)&(var2=1)	This conditional statement is valid
JS#A,var1=0&var2=1	This conditional statement is not valid
Passing Values on the Stack
Parameters can be passed on the subroutine stack
Passing parameters in a subroutine has many advantages including the following
Variable Scope/ Local variables. A subroutine can run with a protected variable space. Local variables exist only in the extent of the subroutine, and no external thread or stack level can access local variables. Local variables can be used for counters, indices, and other helper variables
Each thread has its own stack, therefore subroutines are reentrant. In other words, multiple threads can be running the same subroutine simultaneously at various stack depths.
Support for recursion. Although the subroutine stack is only 16 deep, recursion is possible. A stack depth of 16 is sufficient for many recursive tasks. E.G. recursing axes, handles, and thread status.
Parameter passing. A calling command can explicitly specify the inputs to a subroutine. The subroutine can pass one value back to the calling command. More returns are possible with pass by reference and array passing.
Constants, Variables, and Arrays may be passed up a subroutine stack.
Variables may be passed by value or by reference. If passed by value, a copy is made in the subroutine stack, leaving the original variable immutable. If passed by reference, the original variable's value will be changed when the subroutine writes to its local variable. This is similar, but not exactly analogous to a C pointer.
A variable passed by reference is automatically dereferenced; the variable pointer is not exposed to the user. Following the C syntax, a by-reference pass is accomplished with the ampersand (&) in the invoking call.
IMPORTANT NOTE: When passing a variable by reference, do not allocate any new variables in the called subroutine.
Arrays can be passed in the stack, though only by reference. No "&" is used when passing arrays, by-reference is assumed. To pass an array, use its name in quotations.
IMPORTANT NOTE: Arrays to be passed must have names that are 6 characters or less.
The number of elements in an array is returned by reading index -1, e.g. array[-1].
To return a value on the stack, write the value in the EN command upon ending the subroutine. The parent stack can access this value via _JS.
Examples of valid args (see examples for demo of each concept)
What to pass	arg	Example
Value	the value	JS #square(7)
Variable's value	variable name	JS #sub(var)
Variable by reference	ampersand + variable name	JS #sub(&var)
Array by reference	array name in quotes	JS#sub("array")

LE   Linear Interpolation End
Not Burnable Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program
LE
LE?
Usage	LE	Command takes no arguments
Operands	_LEm	Operand has special meaning, see Remarks
Description
The LE command indicates to the controller that the end of the sequence is coming up. This allows the controller to slow down through multiple segments, if required. LE is required to exit the linear interpolation mode gracefully (stop code, SC, 101).

Arguments
The LE command has no arguments. See the ? Remark below.

Remarks
_LEm will return the total move length in encoder counts for the selected coordinate system, where m is S or T.
If not spcified, the LE command will apply to the last selected coordinate system, S or T.
To select the coordinate system, use the command CA S or CA T.
The VE command is interchangeable with the LE command.
LE ? Returns the total vector move length in encoder counts for the current coordinate system

LI   Linear Interpolation Distance
Not Burnable Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program Variable axis supported
LIm= n <o >p
LI n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n <o >p
Usage	LIm= n	Arguments specified with a single axis mask and an assignment (=)
LI n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Description
The LI command specifies the incremental distance of travel for each axis in the Linear Interpolation (LM) mode. LI parameters are relative distances given with respect to the current axis positions.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
m	A	H	N/A	Axis	Axis to assign value	
n	-8,388,607	8,388,607	0	1	Assigns linear interpolation point for that axis	
o	2	15,000,000	N/A	2	Specifies the vector speed to be commanded at the beginning of the linear segment. The controller will start accelerating or decelerating at the start of the sequence to this speed.	For MT 1,-1,1.5, and -1.5.
2	3,000,000	N/A	2	Specifies the vector speed to be commanded at the beginning of the linear segment. The controller will start accelerating or decelerating at the start of the sequence to this speed.	For MT 2,-2,2.5, and -2.5.
p	2	15,000,000	N/A	2	Specifies the vector speed to be achieved at the end of the linear segment. The controller will decelerate or accelerate during the segment and will reach the specified speed at the end of the segment.	For MT 1,-1,1.5, and -1.5.
2	3,000,000	N/A	2	Specifies the vector speed to be achieved at the end of the linear segment. The controller will decelerate or accelerate during the segment and will reach the specified speed at the end of the segment.	For MT 2,-2,2.5, and -2.5.
Argument	Value	Description	Notes
o	-1	Specifies vector speed to be set by Vector Speed Variable (VV command)	See VV command
Remarks
The CA command is used to set the coordinated system (S or T) for which an LI segment is executed. The default is the S coordinate system (CAS).
The controller always uses the axis specifications from LM, not LI, to compute the speed.
For example: if LM specfies that A-, B-, and C-axis are to be used in linear interpolation mode, but LI only specifies positions for B- and C-, the A-axis will still be used in calculating the overall vector speed.
The maximum independent speed of any axis configured as a stepper must not exceed the maximum value allowable via the SP setting.
The slew speed, set by VS, 'o' or 'p' for linear interpolation mode, is the vector speed based on the axes specified in the LM mode. For example, if LM ABC designates linear interpolation for the A,B and C axes the speed of these axes (Va, Vb, and Vc respectively) will be computed from:
images/linear_interpolation_distance_002.png

The Linear End (LE) command must be given after the last LI segment in a sequence. LE tells the controller to decelerate to a stop at the last LI command.
The BG S or BG T command should be issued before the total LI distance reaches 1,073,741,824 (2^30) encoder counts.
Linear Interpolation Mode Buffer
Up to 511 LI segments may be given ahead of the begin sequence (BG S or BG T) command.
Additional LI commands may be sent during motion when the controller sequence buffer frees additional space for new vector segments.
It is the responsibility of the user to keep enough LI segments in the controller's sequence buffer to ensure continuous motion.
_LMm (_LMS and _LMT) contains the available spaces for LI segments that can be sent to the buffer.
511 returned means the buffer is empty and 511 LI segments can be sent.
A 0 returned means the buffer is full and no additional segments can be sent.
See the LM command for full details.

MC   Motion Complete
Not Burnable Not Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program Trippoint Variable axis supported
MC mm
Usage	MC mm	Argument is an axis mask
Description
The MC command is a trippoint command that holds up execution until motion is complete on the specified axes. The MC command, unlike the AM (after motion command) requires that both the motion profiler has completed motion AND that the motor encoder has reached the specified position before continuing execution.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
mm	A	ABCDEFGH	ABCDEFGH	Multi-Axis Mask	Axis to assign value	Any combination of the axis is valid. If no axis is specified, command applies to all axis.
Remarks
Motion must be actively profiling on an axis for the MC command to take affect. If the MC command is issued for an axis which is not profiling motion, the trippoint will immediately clear.
Using MC with Stepper Motors
With stepper motors, the MC trippoint will clear once the controller has generated the number of step pulses required to complete the move.
The MC command is recommended when operating with stepper motors in lieu of AM since the generation of step pulses can be delayed due to the stepper motor smoothing function, KS. In this case, the MC command would only be satisfied after all steps are generated.
Using MC as part of the #MCTIME error routine
The command TW can be used to set an acceptable amount of time between when the motion profiler has completed and the encoder is in position; if this condition is not satisfied, a timeout error occurs.
When a timeout occurs, the trippoint will clear and the stop code will be set to 99.
Thread 0 of the DMC program will also jump to the special label #MCTIME, if present.
See the #MCTIME automatic subroutine, TW and SC commands for more information

ME   Modbus array write enable
Not Burnable Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program
ME n
Usage	ME n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Description
The ME command enables the ability for Modbus masters to write to array locations in the hardware's array table. When enabled, array locations can be written to as 16 bit integers or as 32 bit floating point by a modbus master by specifying different address ranges. ME is not required to read array locations, reads are always supported.

Arguments
Argument	Value	Description	Notes
n	0	Disables the ability for Modbus masters to write to the array table	Default
1	Enables ability for Modbus masters to write to the array table	
Remarks
Array writes when enabled by ME are done using function code 16
Galil Modbus supports one master per slave.
DMC-4103 requires firmware revision 1.2c or newer for use as Modbus slave.
Modbus Register Map
Each element is accessible as a 16 bit unsigned integer (Modbus registers 10xx) -OR- as a 32 bit floating point number (Modbus registers 2000).
The table below shows the mapping for a Modbus master writing to the controller with ME 1 set.
1000 (0-999) elements are available for read/write on the DMC-4103. Other array elements are not exposed to Modbus.
Modbus Register Map to Galil Array A[]
Modbus Registers:	1000-1999	2000-2999
Available Modbus function codes	3 (read) and 16 (write)	3 (read) and 16 (write)
Number Type	16 bit unsigned integer	32 bit floating point
References in A[] array	A[0]-A[999]	A[0]-A[999]
Number written to A[]	Integer only, fraction not changed	Galil 4.2 format (internal from float conversion)
Number read from A[]	Integer only, fraction not read	32 bit float (internal to float conversion)
Example Modbus Master Write	MBH=0,16,1000,1,write[]	MBH=0,16,2001,2,write[]
Example Modbus Master Read	MBH=0,3,1000,1,read[]	MBH=0,3,2001,2,read[]
Embedded Array Mapping
Once enabled, the entire array table can be written remotely. These writes can span across dimensioned user arrays. It is the user's responsibility to partition the array table and to read/write remotely to the correct location.
When using multiple array names, the array table is partitioned alphabetically (all captital letters first).
For example, a partioned array of Grape[600] and Orange[200] would place the first 600 registers in Grape[], and the next 200 registers in Orange[]. The last 200 elements would be inaccesible from embedded code. If the user then dimensioned the array Apple[200], the register mapping would change. The first 200 registers would read/write from Apple[], the next 600 from Grape[], and finally the last 200 from Orange[].
Additionally, all captial letters come before lowercase letters. For example, a partioned array of Banana[100] and apple[200] would place the first 100 registers in Banana[] and the next 200 registers in apple[].
For simplicity, Galil recommends that a single array be dimensioned with the array name "A".

MFm= n
MF n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n
Usage	MFm= n	Arguments specified with a single axis mask and an assignment (=)
MF n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Description
This command will hold up the execution of the following command until the specified motor moves forward and crosses the position specified.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
m	A	H	N/A	Axis	Axis to assign value	
n	-2,147,483,648	2,147,483,647	N/A	1	Position required to be crossed before subsequent commands will be executed.	
Remarks
Although multiple positions can be specified, only one of the MF conditions must be satisfied for subsequent code execution.
MF command references absolute position.
The MF command only requires an encoder and does not require that the axis be under servo control.
The accuracy of the MF command is the number of counts that occur in 2*TM sec. Multiply the speed by 2*TM sec to obtain the maximum error.
Example with speed of 20,000 counts/second and TM of 1000 (1000 us).
Maximum error = 2 * 1000 E-6 seconds * 20,000 counts/second = 40 counts
When using a stepper motor:
This condition is satisfied when the stepper position (as determined by the output buffer - TD) has crossed the specified Forward Motion Position.

Solicited Messages
From a host terminal, application code, or device, sending the MG command will return with the requested information. This is known as a solicited command, because the host sends the command and expects a response.
Unsolicited Messages
From embedded DMC code, the MG command will send an unsolicited, asynchronous message from the controller to the host. This can be used to alert an operator, send instructions, or return a variable value. This is known as an unsolicited command because the host is not explicitly requesting it.
The CW command controls the ASCII format of all unsolicited messages.
Unsolicited messages can go to any of the Ethernet handles or serial ports.
The CF command sets the default communication port for routing unsolicited messages.
Formatting
Formatters can be placed after each argument in to modify how it is printed.
{Fm.n} Display variable in decimal format with m digits to left of decimal and n to the right.
{Zm.n} Same as {Fm.n} but suppresses leading zeros.
{$m.n} Display variable in hexadecimal format with m digits to left of decimal and n to the right.
{Sn} Display variable as a string of length n, where n is 1 through 6. If n is greater than the length of the string stored in the variable, null chars (0000) will be inserted at the end of the string.
{N} Suppress carriage return at the end of the message.
Message Routing
MG can override the default CF setting by using the following modifiers at the beginning of the message, right after MG.

{Pn} Sends the message out the Serial port n, where n is 1 or 2 denoting Main or Auxilary (where equipped).
{Ex} Sends the message out the Ethernet handle x, where x is A,B,C,D,E,F,G, or H

MO   Motor Off
Burnable Valid in terminal Not Valid while in motion Valid in program Variable axis supported
MO mm
Usage	MO mm	Argument is an axis mask
Operands	_MOm	Operand has special meaning, see Remarks
Description
The MO command turns off the motor command line and toggles the amplifier enable signal.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
mm	A	ABCDEFGH	ABCDEFGH	Multi-Axis Mask	Specifies axis to turn off	
Remarks
The controller will continue to monitor the motor position
See the TP command for more details
To turn the motor back on use the SH (Servo Here) command.
The MO command is useful for positioning the motors by hand.
_MOm contains 1.000 if the axis is in the motor off state or 0.000 if the axes is in the servo here state.

MRm= n
MR n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n
Usage	MRm= n	Arguments specified with a single axis mask and an assignment (=)
MR n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Description
This command will hold up the execution of subsequent DMC code until the specified axis moves backwards and crosses the position specified.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
m	A	H	N/A	Axis	Axis to assign value	
n	-2,147,483,648	2,147,483,647	N/A	1	Value of position that must be crossed in the reverse direction	
Remarks
MR command references absolute position.
Although multiple positions can be specified, only one of the MR conditions must be satisfied for subsequent code execution.
The MR command only requires an encoder and does not require that the axis be under servo control.
The accuracy of the MR command is the number of counts that occur in 2*TM usec. Multiply the speed by 2*TM usec to obtain the maximum error.
Example with speed of 20,000 counts/second and TM of 1000 (1000 us).
Maximum error = 2 * 1000 E-6 seconds * 20,000 counts/second = 40 counts
When using a stepper motor, this condition is satisfied when the stepper position (as determined by the output buffer - TD) has crossed the specified reverse motion position.

Chosing NF, NB, and NZ
A simple way for attaining NF, NB, and NZ parameters is to follow these simple rules:
Estimate the resonance frequency
Set NF equal to the resonance frequency
Set NB = 1/2NF
Set NZ between 0 and 5
The ratio of NB/NF is extremly important. See the NB command for more details.
Maximum Range
The maximum n argument is specified in Hz and is calculated by the equation below:

OA   Off on encoder failure
Burnable Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program Variable axis supported
OAm= n
OA n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n
Usage	OAm= n	Arguments specified with a single axis mask and an assignment (=)
OA n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Operands	_OAm	Operand holds the value last set by the command
Description
The OA command turns on or off encoder failure detection. The controller can detect a failure on either or both channels of the encoder. This is accomplished by checking on whether motion of less than 4 counts is detected whenever the torque exceeds a preset level (OV) for a specified time (OT).

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
m	A	H	N/A	Axis	Axis to assign value	
n	0	1	0	1	Status of encoder failure detection	1 = enabled, 0 = disabled
Remarks
The OA command works like the OE command: if OA is set to 1 and an encoder failure occurs, the axis goes into the motor off (MO) state and the stop code (SC) is set to 12 if detected during motion.
The encoder failure detection will shut the motor off regardless of profiling status, but the stop code is not updated unless the axis is executing a profiled move at the time of the detection of the encoder failure.
If included in the application program and OA is set to 1, #POSERR will run when an encoder failure is detected for the axis.
Note that for this function to work properly it is recommended to have a non-zero value for KI.

OB   Output Bit
Burnable Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program
OB n,(ex)
Usage	OB n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Description
The OB command allows variable control of an output bit based on logical expressions. The OB command defines output bit n as either 0 or 1 depending on the result from the logical expression.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
n	1	16	0	1	Output bit specified	Outputs 9-16 only valid on 5-8 axis controller
n	1,000	8,999	N/A	1	Modbus output bit specified	See Remarks
ex	N/A	N/A	N/A	Expression	Expression that defines status of output	If ex is true/non-zero, set output to 1. If ex is false/zero, set output to 0
Remarks
An expression is any valid logical expression, variable or array element.
Any non-zero value of the expression results in a one set to the output bit.
Using OB with a Modbus Slave
n = (SlaveAddress*10000) + (HandleNum*1000) + ((Module-1)*4) + (Bitnum-1)
Slave Address is used when the ModBus device has slave devices connected to it and specified as Addresses 0 to 255. Please note that the use of slave devices for modbus are very rare and this number will usually be 0.
HandleNum is the handle specifier where A is 1, B is 2 and so on.
Module is the position of the module in the rack from 1 to 16.
BitNum is the I/O point in the module from 1 to 4
Examples
'Galil DMC Code Example
OB 1, pos;'          If pos<>0, Bit 1 is high.

OC   Output Compare
Not Burnable Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program Variable axis supported
OCm = n0, n1
Usage	OCm= n	Arguments specified with a single axis mask and an assignment (=)
Operands	_OC
Operand has special meaning, see Remarks
Description
The OC command sets up the Output Compare feature, also known as Pulse on Position. The controller has a special digital output which can be configured to pulse on a specified absolute encoder position, and optionally on a delta encoder change after that. These operations are known as one-shot and circular compare, respectively.

Each set of 4 axes, ABCD and EFGH, has one digital output which can be configured to this mode of operation

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
m	A	H	N/A	Axis	Axis to enable output compare	Axes A-D share one output compare, axes E-H share a second output compare output
n0	-2,147,483,648	2,147,483,647	N/A	1	Absolute encoder position of first pulse	n0 must be within 65535 counts of current position
n1	-65,536	65,535	N/A	1	Incremental encoder distance between pulses	0 indicates single-shot pulse in positive direction, -65536 indicates single shot when moving in the negative direction
Remarks
For controllers with 5-8 axes, two output compares are available. One for the A-D axes, the other for the E-H axes
This command is only valid when both n0 and n1 are specified.
One shot Compare Mode:
The output compare signal will go low, and stay low at a specified absolute encoder position.
This is done by specifying n1 as 0 for positive motion, and -65536 for negative motion.
Circular Compare Mode:
After the absolute position of the first pulse (n0), the circular compare can be configured to pulse low at a relative distance thereafter (n1).
This is done by specifying n1 to a non-zero delta position (range of -65535 to 65535).
OCA = 0 will disable the Circular Compare function on axes A-D.
OCE = 0 will disable the Circular Compare function on axes E-H.
The circular compare output is a low-going pulse with a duration of approximately 510 nanoseconds.
Limitations
The Output Compare function is only valid with incremental encoders.
The Output Compare function is not valid with SIN/COS (AF settings of 5-12), standard analog (AF setting of 1), BiSS or SSI feedback (SS or SI commands).
The OC function cannot work for an axis configured as a stepper.
The auxiliary encoder of the corresponding axis cannot be used when in this mode.
Dual loop mode (which uses the aux encoder input) will not operate when the OC command is enabled.
The OC function requires that the main encoder and auxiliary encoders be configured exactly the same (see the command, CE). For example: CE 0, CE 5, CE 10, CE 15.
OC only requires an encoder, and is independent of axis tuning, and motion profiling.
Operand Usage
_OC contains the state of the OC function.

OE   Off-on-Error
Burnable Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program Variable axis supported
OEm= n
OE n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n
Usage	OEm= n	Arguments specified with a single axis mask and an assignment (=)
OE n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Operands	_OEm	Operand holds the value last set by the command
Description
The OE command sets the Off On Error function for the controller. The OE command causes the controller to shut off the motor command if a position error exceeds the limit specified by the ER command, an abort occurs from either the abort input or on AB command, or an amplifier error occurs based on the description of the TA command.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
m	A	H	N/A	Axis	Axis to assign value	
n	0	0	0	0	Disables the Off On Error Function	Default
1	1	0	0	Motor shut off by position error, amplifier error or abort input	
2	2	0	0	Motor shut off by hardware limit switch	
3	3	0	0	Motor shut off by position error, amplifier error, abort input or by hardware limit switch	
Remarks
For any value of OE <> 0, the axis will be shut off due to amplifier faults on any amplifier axis. See the TA command for conditions of an amplifier fault.
BR1 must be enabled when internal brushless servo amplifiers are installed but the axis is driven with an external amplifier. BR1 disables hall error checking when OE <> 0
Examples of brushless servo amps that require this consideration include the AMP-43040 (-D3040) or the AMP-20540
Motion Behavior:
If an error or axis-specific abort is detected, and the motion was executing an independent move, only that axis will be shut off.
If the motion is a part of coordinated mode of the types GM, VM, LM or CM, all participating axes will be stopped.

Description
The OV command sets the threshold voltage for detecting an encoder failure. The controller can detect a failure on either or both channels of the encoder.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
m	A	H	N/A	Axis	Axis to assign value	
n	0	9.9982	0.9438	20/65,536	Torque voltage to trigger encoder error detection	
Remarks
Encoder error detection is accomplished by checking on whether motion of at least 4 counts is detected whenever the torque exceeds a preset level (OV) for a specified time (OT).
Note that for this function to work properly it is recommended to have a non-zero value for KI.
The value of OV should be high enough to guarantee that the motor would overcome any static friction in the system. If it is too low, there will be false triggering of the error condition.
The OV value may not be higher than the TL value.
See the OA command for more details on this error detection mode

Operands	_PLm	Operand holds the value last set by the command
Description
The PL command adds a low-pass filter in series with the PID compensation.

The crossover frequency is entered directly as an argument to PL. To maintain compatibility with earlier versions, a value less than 1 may also be specified.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
m	A	H	N/A	Axis	Axis to assign value	
n	0	250	0	1	Crossover frequency created by the PL command	'Max' is a function of TM. See Remarks. n = 0 disables the Pole filter.
0	0.9999	0	2/65,536	Value used to generate pole filter crossover frequency	See Remarks for the equation used. n = 0 disables the Pole filter
Remarks
At lower TM settings, the maximum pole frequency is increased. The maximum value of the PL command is determined by the value of TM according to the following equation
Max = (1/4 * 10^6) * (1/TM)
The digital transfer function of the filter is (1 - n) / (Z - n) and the equivalent continuous filter is A/(S+A) where A is the filter cutoff frequency: A=(1/T) ln (1 / n) rad/sec and T is the sample time.
Calculated Pole
To convert from the desired crossover (-3 dB) frequency in Hertz to the value given to PL, use the following formula
images/pole_001.png

where
n is the argument given to PL (less than 1)
T is the controller's servo loop sample time in seconds (TM divided by 1,000,000)
Fc is the crossover frequency in Hertz
Example: Fc=36Hz TM=1000 n=e^(-0.001*36*2*pi) =0.8
The following shows several example crossover frequencies achieved with various values of PL

Remarks
The PA command is used to give the controller an absolute position target. Motion commands other than PA are not supported in this mode.
The motion profile is trapezoidal with the parameters controlled by acceleration, deceleration, and speed (AD, DC, SP).
When in the PT mode the ST command will exit the mode.
The AM and MC trip points are not valid in this mode.
MF and MR are recommended with this mode as they allow the user to specify both the absolute position, and the direction. The AP trip point may also be used.
Position Tracking is not valid on virtual axes

QH   Query Hall State
Not Burnable Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program Variable axis supported
QH mm
Usage	QH mm	Argument is an axis mask
Operands	_QHm	Operand has special meaning, see Remarks
Description
The QH command transmits the state of the Hall sensor inputs. The value is decimal and represented by a 3 bit value (see Remarks).

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
mm	A	ABCDEFGH	ABCDEFGH	Multi-Axis Mask	Axes to return Hall status	
Remarks
The 3 bit value returned by QH is defined in the table below:
Bit	Status
07	Undefined (set to 0)
06	Undefined (set to 0)
05	Undefined (set to 0)
04	Undefined (set to 0)
03	Undefined (set to 0)
02	Hall C State
01	Hall B State
00	Hall A State
QH should return a value from 1 through 6 as valid Hall combinations. A value of 0 or 7 is invalid when using Hall sensors and will generate a Hall error with OE set.
The valid sequence for Hall inputs is a greycode output (only one bit changes at a time):
1,3,2,6,4,5 (or 5,4,6,2,3,1)
To disable Hall error checking, set the axis to brushed with a BR 1 command.
When using an internal sine amplifier, the BA command must be issued before QH will report the Hall state status.
Operand Usage
_QHm Contains the state of the Hall sensor inputs for the specified axis
Examples
'Galil DMC Code Example

QQ   Clear Sample Time Overflow
Not Burnable Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program
QQ
Usage	QQ	Command takes no arguments
Operands	_QQ
Operand has special meaning, see Remarks
Description
QQ is used along with #FWERR to detect a sample overflow. Many features require that the controller perform an action every sample. Running many of these features simultaneously can lead to there not being enough time to complete every action. See remarks for a list of these features. In the event that a sample overflow occurs, the QQ command is used to report and clear this error. For the majority of applications, this will never occur. This behavior should only occur when running a low sample time (TM) and using absolute encoders with a high number of bits at a low clock frequency.

Arguments
The QQ command has no arguments.

Remarks
If the servo sample has not yet overflowed, the value of _QQ will be 0.
If the servo sample has overflowed and not yet been cleared, _QQ will be 1.
The following are features, and their associated DMC comands, which add a non-negligible amount of time to the servo sample calculations.
Serial Encoders (SI/SS)
Analog Encoders (AF)
Notch Filter (NF,NZ,NB)
Low Sample Time setting (TM)

n0 = non zero number automatically starts record mode.
n0 = ? returns status of recording. '1' if recording, '0' if not recording.
Second Parameter Rules
n1 specifies the last array element to use for record mode.
If arrays specified by RA have different sizes, the smallest array size is the maximum value for n1
If n1 = 0 or not specified, the maximum value is used.
A negative value for n1 specifies circular (continuous) record over array addresses 0 to (n1-1).
The absolute value of the minimum n1 allowed = maximum n1 allowed
Operand Usage
_RC contains status of recording. '1' if recording, '0' if not recording.
Setting up the record array mode
Dimension an array/arrays for storing data. Make sure you dimension the array with the number of elements required to capture data for your application.
Set the RA command with the arrays to be used for recording.
Set the RD command with the data sources to be applied to the arrays. The order of your arrays entered into RA will match the order of data sources set by RD.
Set the RC command to get the desired time between records and enable the recording.
Monitor the _RC operand for a 0 to indicate recording is done.

_OP	Output status	
_RLm	Latched position	
_RPm	Commanded position	_RPm and _SHm capture the same data
_SCm	Stop code	
_SHm	Commanded position	_RPm and _SHm capture the same data
_TDm	Auxiliary encoder position	_DEm and _TDm capture the same data
_TEm	Position error	
_TI	Input status	
_TPm	Encoder position	
_TSm	Switches	Only bits 0-4 valid
_TTm	Torque command	The values recorded for torque are in the range of +/- 32767 where 0 is 0 torque, -32767 is -10 volt command output, and +32767 is +10 volt.
_TVm	Filtered velocity	This value will be 64 times greater than TV command
Remarks
Arguments listed as _XXm are valid when m is a valid axis mask
The order of args specified in RD corresponds with the array order specified in the RA command.
the operand _RD contains the address for the next array element for recording.
When recording _AFm, the returned value is signed. This means that when AQ is used to set unipolar inputs, values on the upper half of the voltage range are sign extended. Anding the value with $0000FFFF will return the expected unsigned value.

RE   Return from Error Routine
Not Burnable Not Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program
RE n
Usage	RE n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Description
The RE command is used to end subroutines in application code. An RE at the end of these routines causes a return to the main program. Specific automatic error subroutines require the use of the RE command to end the code correctly.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
n	0	1	0	1	Determines state of interrupted trippoint when returning from an automatic subroutine.	n = 1 restores the interrupted trippoint. n = 0 clears the trippoint
Remarks
The RE command is used to end the following error automatic subroutines.
Automatic Subroutines Used	Notes
#AMPERR	Only when using internal amps
#LIMSWI	
#POSERR	
#SERERR	Only when equipped with serial encoder firmware support
#TCPERR	
Care should be taken to ensure the error conditions are cleared when finishing the subroutine to avoid immediate re-entering of the error routine.
To avoid returning to the main program on an interrupt, use the ZS command to zero the subroutine stack, then use JP to return to the desired location in code.
RE 1 restores the trippoint that was interrupted by an automatic subroutine (like WT)
A motion trippoint like MF or MR requires the axis to be actively profiling in order to be restored with the RE 1 command.

REM   Remark
Not Burnable Not Valid in terminal Not Valid while in motion Not Valid in program
REM str
Description
REM is used for comment lines. The REM statement is NOT a controller command. Rather, it is recognized by Galil PC software, which strips away the REM lines before downloading the DMC file to the controller.

Arguments
Argument	Value	Description	Notes
str	String	Comment to be removed from code prior to download	This comment is not limited by the character limit of the controller, as it is never downloaded
Remarks
REM differs from NO (or ') in the following ways:
NO (or ') comments are downloaded to the controller and REM comments are not.
NO (or ') comments take up execution time and REM comments don't; therefore, REM should be used for code that needs to run fast.
REM comments cannot be recovered when uploading a program but NO (or ') comments are recovered. Thus the uploaded program is less readable with REM.
NO (or ') comments take up program line space and REM lines do not.
REM comments must be the first and only thing on a line, whereas NO (or ') can be used to place comments to the right of code (after a semicolon) on the same line.
Examples
'Galil DMC Code Example
REM This comment will be stripped when downloaded to the controller
'This comment will be downloaded and takes some execution time
PRX=1000 ;'this comment is to the right of the code

RI   Return from Interrupt Routine
Not Burnable Not Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program
RI n
Usage	RI n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Description
The RI command is used to end the input interrupt subroutine.

The input interrupt subroutine begins with the label #ININT. An RI at the end of this routine causes a return to the main program.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
n	0	1	0	1	Determines state of interrupted trippoint when returning from an automatic subroutine.	n = 0 clears the trippoint. n = 1 restores the interrupted trippoint.
Remarks
To avoid returning to the main program on an interrupt, use the command ZS to zero the subroutine stack. This turns the jump subroutine into a jump only. Refer to Application Note 2418.
http://www.galil.com/download/application-note/note2418.pdf
If the program sequencer was interrupted while waiting for a trippoint, such as WT, RI 1 restores the trippoint on the return to the program. RI 0 clears the trippoint.
A motion trippoint like MF or MR requires the axis to be actively profiling in order to be restored with the RI1 command.
The RI command re-enables input interrupts.
Examples
'Galil DMC Code Example
#A;II1;JP #A;EN;' Program label
#ININT;' Begin interrupt subroutine

Capturing Stepper Position using the Latch
When working with a stepper motor without an encoder, the latch can be used to capture the stepper position. Follow the steps below to achieve this.
Place a wire from the controller Step (PWM) output into the main encoder input, channel A+.
Connect the Direction (sign) output into the channel B+ input.
Configure the main encoder for Step/Direction using the CE command.
The latch will now capture the stepper position based on the pulses generated by the controller.

TIME   Time Operand
Not Burnable Valid in terminal Valid while in motion Valid in program
TIME
Usage	variable= TIME	Holds a value
Operands	TIME
Operand has special meaning, see Remarks
Description
The TIME operand returns the value of the internal free running, real time clock.

The returned value represents the number of servo loop updates and is based on the TM command. The default value for the TM command is 1000. With this update rate, the operand TIME will increase by 1 count every update of approximately 1000usec. The clock is reset to 0 with a standard reset or a master reset.

Arguments
TIME is an operand and has no parameters

Remarks
The keyword, TIME, does not require an underscore (_) as with the other operands.
TIME will increment up to +2,147,483,647 before rolling over to -2,147,483,648 and continuing to count up.
TIME rollover occurs after ~24-25 days of on-time at TM 1000 with no reset.
TM 1000 will actually set an update rate of 976 microseconds. Thus the value returned by the TIME operand will be off by 2.4% of the actual time.
Examples
'Galil DMC Code Example
MG TIME;'  Display the value of the internal clock
t1=TIME;'  Sets the variable t1 to the TIME value

Usage	TKm= n	Arguments specified with a single axis mask and an assignment (=)
TK n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Operands	_TKm	Operand holds the value last set by the command
Description
The TK command sets the peak torque limit on the motor command output. This command works with the TL command which sets the continuous torque limit. When the average torque is below TL, the motor command signal can go up to the TK (Peak Torque) limit for a short amount of time.

To convert motor command output (V) to actual motor current (A), use the following equation.

images/motor_current_equation.png

For Galil controllers with internal drives, refer to AG command for amplifier gain setting. For external drive control, consult drive documentation.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
m	A	H	N/A	Axis	Axis to assign value	
n	0	9.9982	0	20/65,536	Value of peak torque limit	n = 0 disables the peak torque limit
Remarks
TK provides the absolute value of the peak torque limit for -/+ torque outputs
Peak torque can be achieved for approximately 1000 samples upon initial command from 0V torque
If TK is set lower than TL, then TL is the maximum command output under all circumstances
TK should be set after the amplifier gain is selected

Usage	TLm= n	Arguments specified with a single axis mask and an assignment (=)
TL n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Operands	_TLm	Operand holds the value last set by the command
Description
The TL command sets the limit on the motor command output. This limit is designed to prevent over current to motors with lower current rating than the drive.

To convert motor command output (V) to actual motor current (A), use the following equation.

images/motor_current_equation.png

For Galil controllers with internal drives, refer to AG command for amplifier gain setting.

TL works along with the TK (Peak torque) command to control output current to the motor.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
m	A	H	N/A	Axis	Axis to assign value	
n	0	9.9982	9.9982	20/65,536	Value of torque limit	
TL With Internal Drives
When using the maximum AG setting, the maximum torque limit will automatically be lowered to ensure the amplifier is limited to its rated continuous current.
The maximum torque limit is different for certain amplifiers when configured for its maximum AG setting.
Amplifier	AG setting	TL limit
D3040	2	7
D3240	2	5
D3540	2	5
D3547	2	5
D3640	N/A	5
Remarks
TL sets the absolute torque maximum for negative and positive torque.
For example, TL of 5 limits the motor command output to 5 volts maximum and -5 volts minimum.
TL should be set after the amplifier gain is selected.

The TN command describes the tangent axis to the coordinated motion path. n0 is the scale factor in counts/degree of the tangent axis. n1 is the absolute position of the tangent axis where the tangent axis is aligned with zero degrees in the coordinated motion plane. The tangent function is useful for cutting applications where a cutting tool must remain tangent to the part.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
n0	-127	127	0	0.004	Scale factor in counts/degree of the tangent axis	
n1	-8,388,608	8,388,607	0	1	Absolute position of tangent axis where the tangent angle is 0	
Remarks
When operating with stepper motors, n0 is the scale factor in steps / degree
The tangent axis is specified with the VMm0m1m2 command where m2 is the tangent axis.
For example, VMABD specifies the D axis as the tangent axis
Operand Usage
_TNm (where m = S or T) contains the first position value for the tangent axis in the specified vector plane. This allows the user to correctly position the tangent axis before the motion begins.
_TNm will change based upon the vector path described in the VM declaration. See the example below.
n0 = ? also reports this value
Examples
Use a 2D table with a tangent cutting blade to cut a half circle. Ensure that the blade is oriented before turning on the saw. The saw is activated with output 1.

VM   Vector Mode
Not Burnable Valid in terminal Not Valid while in motion Valid in program
VM m0m1m2
Usage	VM mm	Argument is an axis mask
Operands	_VMm
Operand has special meaning, see Remarks
Description
The VM command enables the coordinated motion mode and specifies the plane of motion. This mode may be specified for motion on any set of two axes, including a combination of real and virtual axes for single-axis operation. The motion is specified by the instructions VP and CR, which specify linear and circular segments.

Up to 511 segments may be given before the Begin Sequence (BGS or BGT) command. The number of available segments is queriable via the _LMm operand.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
m0	A	H	A	Axis	First axis specified for vector motion	
m1	A	H	N/A	Axis	Second axis specified for vector motion	
M	N	N/A	Axis	Virtual axis specified for vector mode	Used when performing vector mode for a single real axis
m2	A	H	N/A	Axis	Tangent axis specified for vector mode.	m2 = null if tangent mode is not desired.
M	N	N/A	Axis	Virtual axis specified for vector mode.	Used to disable the tangent function if already enabled. Otherwise, use m2 = null.
Remarks
Specifying one axis for vector mode is useful for obtaining sinusoidal motion on 1 axis using the CR command.
The Vector End (VE) command must be given after the last segment. This allows the controller to properly decelerate.
Additional segments may be given during the motion when the buffer frees additional spaces for new segments.
It is the responsibility of the user to keep enough motion segments in the buffer to ensure continuous motion.
The first vector in a coordinated motion sequence defines the origin for that sequence. All other vectors in the sequence are defined by their endpoints with respect to the start of the move sequence.
The VM command will apply to the selected coordinate system, S or T. To select the coordinate system, use the command CAS or CAT.
_VMm contains instantaneous commanded vector velocity for the specified coordinate system, S or T.
Enabling Vector Mode
Specify the desired coordinate system to use with the CA command. S is default.
Specify the vector plane to be used with the VMm0m1 command. If using tangent axis include that as the m2 parameter
EG. for a AB vector plane with the D axis used as a tangent axis, issue VM ABD
If only the vector plane is desired for the above example, then issue VM AB
Specify vector speed with VS, vector acceleration with VA, and vector deceleration with VD
Specify vector segments with the VP command, or circular segments with the CR command
When finished with the sequence of moves, issue VE
Issue BGS to begin motion for the S coordinate system
You can now wait for motion to complete, issue additional segments as buffer space is cleared, or start a new move on the T coordinate plane by specifying CAT and starting from step 2.

Argument	Value	Description	Notes
o	-1	Specifies vector speed to be set by Vector Speed Variable (VV command)	See VV command
Remarks
The first vector in a coordinated motion sequence defines the origin for that sequence. All other vectors in the sequence are defined by their endpoints with respect to the start of the move sequence.
Vector moves are defined as absolute positions from the origin of the sequence.
The length of each vector segment must be limited to 8,388,607.
The VM command will apply to the selected coordinate system, S or T. To select the coordinate system, use the command CAS or CAT.
_VPm where m = axis designator A,B,C,D,E,F,G or H and contains the absolute coordinate of the axes at the last intersection along the sequence.
For example, during the first motion segment, this instruction returns the coordinate at the start of the sequence.
The use of _VPm as an operand is valid in the linear mode, LM, and in the Vector mode, VM.

VSm= n
VS n,n
Usage	VSm= n	Arguments specified with a single axis mask and an assignment (=)
VS n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Description
The VS command specifies the speed of the vector in a coordinated motion sequence in either the LM or VM modes. This speed is in place when individual segment speeds for VP, LI and CR are not specified.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
m	S	T	S	Axis	Coordinate plane to be specified	
n	2	15,000,000	25,000	2	Vector speed applied to the coordinate system	
Remarks
Vector speed can be attached to individual vector segments using the operators '<' and '>'. For more information, see description of VP, CR, and LI commands. The VV command allows for variables to be specified during vector segments.
Vector Speed can be calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squared values of speed for each axis specified for vector or linear interpolated motion.
_VSm contains the vector speed of the specified coordinate system
When issuing VS implicitly, the first argument refers to the "S" plane and the second refers to the "T" plane.

VV n,n
Usage	VVm= n	Arguments specified with a single axis mask and an assignment (=)
VV n ...	Arguments specified with an implicit, comma-separated order
Operands	_VVm	Operand has special meaning, see Remarks
Description
The VV command sets the speed of the vector variable in a coordinated motion sequence in either the LM or VM modes. The VV command is used to set the "o" vector speed argument for segments that exist in the vector buffer for LI, CR and VP commands. By defining a vector segment begin speed as a negative 1 (i.e. "<-1"), the controller will utilize the current vector variable speed as the segment is profiled from the buffer.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
m	S	T	S	Axis	Coordinate plane to assign value	
n	0	15,000,000	0	2	Variable vector speed	For MT 1,-1,1.5 and -1.5
0	3,000,000	0	2	Variable vector speed	For MT 2,-2,2.5 and -2.5
Remarks
VV command is useful when vector segments exist in the buffer that use the "<" and ">" speed indicators for specific segment and corner speed control and the host needs to be able to dynamically change the nominal return operating speed.
_VVm contains the vector speed variable of the specified coordinate system
Examples
'Galil DMC Code Example
:VVS= 20000;'          Define vector speed variable to 20000 for the S coordinate system

Description
The YR command allows the user to correct for position error in Stepper Position Maintenance mode. This correction acts like an IP command, moving the axis or axes the specified quantity of step counts. YR will typically be used in conjunction with QS.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes

Remarks
Users will typically use the value of QS to increment motor by the number of step pulses of error.
EG. YRm = _QSm increments the specified axis by the error magnitude.
The sign of YR depends on the polarity of the position encoder
If the encoder increments when the stepper moves forward (increasing TD), the correction is YRm=_QSm. This is typical.
If the encoder decrements when the stepper moves forward, the correction is YRm= -_QSm. See CE to invert the polarity of the position encoder, if desired.

The ZS command is used to clear the stack when finishing or leaving a subroutine. This command is used to avoid returning from an interrupt (either input or error). This turns the jump to subroutine into a jump. The status of the stack can be interrogated with the operand _ZS, see Remarks.

Arguments
Argument	Min	Max	Default	Resolution	Description	Notes
n	0	1	0	1	Sets zero stack operation	n = 0 clears the entire stack. n = 1 clears one level of the stack.
Remarks
Do not use RI (Return from Interrupt) when using ZS.
To re-enable interrupts, you must use II command again.
Operand Usage
_ZSn contains the stack level for the specified thread where n = 0 to 7.
The response, an integer between zero and sixteen, indicates zero for beginning condition and sixteen for the deepest value.
